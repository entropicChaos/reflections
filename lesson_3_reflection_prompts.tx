When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i need to share my work with others

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork is basically cloning someone's repository on mine gitHub account, giving credits to him.
Clones are copies you made on your local pc and branches...
