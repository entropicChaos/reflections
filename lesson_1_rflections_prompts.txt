How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Well because diff -u will show me the differences between the two files and therfor i will be able to spot the wrong one

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I don't know this one

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The major cons is that i could easyly forget to save my changes or something could happen (like a Blackout) and waste all my job.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
because git is more programming orienteated
